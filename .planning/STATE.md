# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Deliver the right infrastructure and real estate news at the right time — so the user never misses critical developments and saves 2+ hours of daily manual research.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Project Scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Project Scaffold)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-27 — Plan 01-01 complete (repository scaffold, uv sync, package imports verified)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Railway over Vercel for bot: persistent process, no cold starts, polling mode simpler than webhooks
- GitHub repo as data store: free, version-controlled, no DB needed — seen.json, config.json, keywords.json
- Claude primary, Gemini fallback: better analysis quality, fallback for reliability
- google-genai (not google-generativeai): deprecated EOL Nov 2025
- hatchling build backend: uv default, zero-config for src-layout, enables editable install via uv sync
- src-layout chosen: prevents working-directory import trap; from pipeline.X import Y works from any cwd
- data/history.json not gitignored: INFRA-02 requires state files committed to repo

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (AI classification): Prompt engineering for Indian real estate domain may need 2-3 iteration cycles — calibrate threshold against real article sets before locking system prompt
- Phase 3 (GNews quota): Design Boolean-grouped queries from day one — never one-query-per-keyword or 100 req/day limit will be exhausted
- Phase 2 (scheduling): Validate IST/UTC cron expressions against first 3 live runs before trusting automation
